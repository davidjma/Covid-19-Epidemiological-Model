# Covid-19-Epidemiological-Model

This respiratory contains the files that describe predictions of Covid-19 using epidemiological models. In `project.ipyb`, a prediction of Covid population groups are depicted where discrete and dynamical systems are researched and different subpopulations within the pandemic are shown. The fluctuation of the subpopulations are also shown to see if these models can accurately depict a real-life scenario.
